In this report we will analyse how the storage capacity of a Hopfield Network changes when the Hebbian weight matrices is altered so that reciprocal connections are no longer symmetric. Furthermore Dale's law is considered, stating that synaptic connections to post-synaptic neurons are either of the excitatory or inhibitory type, never both. This makes the network more realistic.
