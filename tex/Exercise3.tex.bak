\section{Exercise 3: Random asymmetry}

\begin{itshape}
\small
To investigate the robustness of pattern retrieval against asymmetry in the weight matrix, consider now networks where for each pairs of nodes $\l(i, j\r)$, the directed connection from node $i$ to node $j$ is cut with probability $p_{cut}$. This will introduce asymmetry in the Hebbian weight matrix Eq. 1.

Set $c=0.1$ and $N = 200$. As in Ex. 2 calculate and plot the mean $\alpha_{N,max}$ for varying $p_{cut}$ with error bars (at least 10 repetitions). At which $p_{cut}$ does the maximal load drop below $50\%$ of the value estimated in Ex. 2? State the confidence interval.

Note: Bare in mind that the convergence assertion of Question 1.1 does not necessarily hold for $p_{cut} > 0$.

Figure \ref{fig:exercise3} shows the the $\alpha_{N,max}$ over varying $p_{cut}$.

With increasing $p_{cut}$ the maximal load decreases. At $p_{cut} = xxx$ the maximal load drops below $50\%$ of the value estimated in exercise 2.
