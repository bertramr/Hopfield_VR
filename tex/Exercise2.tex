\section{Exercise 2: Capacity estimation}

\begin{itshape}
\small
We now define the capacity of a Hopfield network of size N as the number of patterns $P_{N,max}$ that can be stored, such that the mean retrieval error averaged over all stored patterns (one retrieval attempt each) is at most 2$\%$. This yields the maximal load $\alpha_{N,max} = \frac{P_{N,max} }{N}$.

Set c=0.1. Calculate $\alpha_{N,max}$ for at least 10 network realizations and state the mean together with confidence intervals. Do this for N = 100, 250 and one other larger network size. Shortly interpret the resulting values and compare with results from literature.
