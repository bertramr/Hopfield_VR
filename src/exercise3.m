%% Exercise 3: Random asymmetry
% To investigate the robustness of pattern retrieval against asymmetry in the weight matrix, consider
% now networks where for each pairs of nodes (i, j), the directed connection from node i to node j is
% cut with probability pcut . This will introduce asymmetry in the Hebbian weight matrix Eq. 1.
% Set c=0.1 and N = 200. As in Ex. 2 calculate and plot the mean â†µN,max for varying pcut with
% error bars (at least 10 repetitions). At which pcut does the maximal load drop below 50% of the
% value estimated in Ex. 2? State the confidence interval.
% Note: Bare in mind that the convergence assertion of Question 1.1 does not necessarily hold for
% pcut > 0.
