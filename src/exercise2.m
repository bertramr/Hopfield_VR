%% Exercise 2

%%
% We now define the capacity of a Hopfield network of size N as the number of
% patterns PN,max that can be stored, such that the mean retrieval error 
% averaged over all stored patterns (one retrieval P attempt each) is at most
% 2%. This yields the maximal load ↵N,max = N,max . N
% Set c=0.1. Calculate ↵N,max for at least 10 network realizations and state 
% the mean together with confidence intervals. Do this for N = 100, 250 and
% one other larger network size. Shortly interpret
% the resulting values and compare with results from literature.
